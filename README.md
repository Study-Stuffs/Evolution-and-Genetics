## Evolution 
---
### 1. Introduction

- **Charles Darwin** was the first to propose the theory of evolution by natural selection.
- Darwin defined **evolution** as "descent with modification". The idea is that all living things are related and have descended from a common ancestor.
- The mechanism of evolution is **natural selection**. This is the process by which organisms with certain inherited traits are more likely to survive and reproduce than others.
- Natural selection causes populations to become **adapted** to their environment. Adaptation is the process by which a population becomes better suited to its environment.
- Natural selection is a **random process**. It does not favour any particular individual or trait. It is the result of the interaction of many factors, including **mutation**, **genetic drift**, **migration** and **sexual selection**.
  
### 2. Natural Selection

Darwin also proposed a mechanism for evolution: **Natural selection**.This mechanism was elegant and logical, and it explained how populations could evolve in such a way that they became better suited to their environments over time.

**2.1 Concepts of natural selection**
- **traits are often heritable**. This means that they are passed on from parents to offspring.

- **More offsprint are produced than can survive**. This is because not all offspring survive to adulthood. This is because of **predation**, **disease**, **competition** and **environmental factors**.

- **Offspring vary in their traits**. This is because of **mutation** and **recombination**. Mutation is the process by which a gene is changed. Recombination is the process by which genes are shuffled during the formation of gametes.

- **Traits are not randomly distributed**. This is because some traits are more useful than others. For example, a bird with a longer beak is more likely to survive than a bird with a shorter beak (Under certain environmental conditions ofcourse).

As the above indicates, those alleles(one of two or more versions of DNA sequence) of a species that are favored in the environment will be more likely to be passed on to the next generation. This is the process of **natural selection**.

### 3. Adaptation
An **adaptation** is a characteristic that enhances the survival or reproduction of an organism that bear it, relative to alternative character states. The word "adaptation" also refers to the process whereby the members of a population become better suited to some feature of their environment through change in a characteristic that affects their survival or reproduction.

**3.1 The Nature of Adaptations**
"An adaptation is a phenotypic variant that results in the highest fitness among a specific set of phenotypic variants in a given environment." This definition is a bit complicated, so let's break it down.

The first part of the definition is the **phenotypic variant**. This is a characteristic of an organism that can be observed. For example, the colour of a bird's feathers is a phenotypic variant.

The second part of the definition is **fitness**. This is the ability of an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment. For example, a bird with a longer beak is more likely to survive than a bird with a shorter beak.

The third part of the definition is **environment**. This is the surroundings in which an organism lives. For example, the environment of a bird is the air, the ground and the trees.

"The sutures(surgical stitches) in the skulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition (birth), and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable for this act, but as sutures occur in the skulls of all mammals, and as the young of all mammals are born alive, it is clear that the sutures are not an adaptation for birth, but are an adaptation for the young to be born alive." - Charles Darwin (*The origin of species*,chapter 6).
**preadaptation** is a feature that fortuitously(by luck) exists in an organism, but is not used for its current function. For example, the human appendix is a preadaptation. It is a vestigial organ that is no longer used for its original function. It is thought that the appendix may have been used for digestion in our ancestors, but is no longer used for this purpose.
